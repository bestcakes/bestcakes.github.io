<p>Some couples have a smaller display cake, which is supplemented by sheet cake. That prize bake won’t last long but keep it fresh until it’s gone with a cake stand with a lid. Reward this week’s star baker with personalised cake stands that cement their title. I now have a good few biscoff recipes on my blog and they are always super popular because a lot of you seem to. The groom's cake is a tradition observed mainly in the southern united states.</p>

<p>I now have a good few biscoff recipes on my blog and they are always super popular because a lot of you seem to. Our wedding cakes were the talk of our wedding! Cutting the wedding cake is often turned into a ritual, complete with sharing a symbolic bite of the cake in a rite that harks back to the pagan confarreatio weddings in ancient rome. The three tiered cake was red and white in colour with a decoration piece which read 'mr and mrs cooper' standing on top. We went to charity fent with this idea of a very large, modern wedding cake and she did not disappoint!</p>
