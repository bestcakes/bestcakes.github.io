<p><strong>Baking A Nice Cake</strong>. In a separate bowl, beat together butter, sugar, and eggs. You'll need only seven everyday ingredients to make this easy, versatile recipe, which you can use to bake a 9x9 cake or a dozen cupcakes. This buttermilk pound cake has a dense, moist crumb and bags of lemon flavour to cut through the richness. For best results, beat them together until the texture is light and fluffy, about three to four minutes.</p>
