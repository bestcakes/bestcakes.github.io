<p><strong>Best Cake Banapple</strong>. Good for 1 to many. ~php 110 per slice ~ php 1000 whole cake. These are meals that taste like home and i would liken the experience to eating in pancake house. Their cheesecakes have an amazingly thick crust, which is normally not what you’re after when it comes to cheesecake, but the buttery and crumbly feel to it compliments the cake wonderfully.</p>

<p>But one common factor these experiences have is the good food that we shared in banapple. This is now my favorite cake in banapple. Christmas pies, cakes, and cheesecakes. I got introduced to this by my sisters who are so sweet. You can enjoy the following pie and cake flavors: I ended up eating a slice more than i should.</p>
<h3 id="i-love-this-one-a-lot-like-a-lot">I love this one a lot, like a lot.</h3><p>The simple blueberry cheesecake used to be my first and banoffee pie my second pero mas favorite ko na nga 'yung isa. Their caramel cake is the best. Banapple is arguably the most popular cheesecake place in manila, and for good reason. It's a home based business, you have to order at least a day ahead and pick it up. Plus, it has a generous amount of cream cheese filling , enveloping the cake that you get to enjoy. Banapple has become a pleasant landmark, and commuters stop for a quick take out to and from work and school.</p>

<p>Another favorite of this kind is tokwa't baboy with tausi (tofu &amp; pork with black beans). In fairness, kung anong itsura niya ganun siya kasarap. Banoffee pie, apple caramel crumble pie, blueberry cheesecake, very berry custard cake, snicker fudge cheesecake, and super caramel fudge cheesecake. Their caramel cake is the best. Okay naman din 'to kaso naparami 'yung oil.</p>
