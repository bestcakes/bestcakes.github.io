<p><strong>Best Cake Crust Recipe</strong>. For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla &amp; salt), it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the perfect version. The best part about this flourless chocolate cake is that it doesn't require any flour alternatives. The topping consists of melted butter, light brown sugar, pineapple slices, and maraschino cherries. Add cocoa, stir to combine, then turn off heat.</p>

<p>The finished product should have visible sections of shortening and butter. Many of my friends have tried that recipe, and think it is ruined, and toss it. Making your pie crust from scratch is a lot easier than you might think. The only thing with the recipe is that there is not enough water in it you need to add at least 1/4 cup more to have the dough come together. It turns cynics into converts. The best part about this flourless chocolate cake is that it doesn't require any flour alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-the-best-butter-cake-ever">This is the best butter cake ever!</h3><p>It's just the perfect cake that happens to have. Melted on the stove in a pot, then a dry mix combined in one bowl and a wet mix combined in another bowl, and a headache. The only amendments i make are to cut very thin pieces of the crust off all the way around. As the cake cooks that buttery glaze creeps up along the edges and bakes right ins, resulting in a caramelized crisp, butter crust, which to me is the best part!! This one cookie recipe makes tons of other recipes and it is the only one we make. Now we don't go to the pizza shop.we don't need to with this recipe!</p>
