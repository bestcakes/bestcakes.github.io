The sense of achievement once it is over and you have a count up to see what you have raised for macmillan is amazing. Our classic date and walnut cake recipe from woman's weekly is topped with delicious cream cheese icing and chopped nuts. The little book of treats is produced by macmillan cancer support and 100% of the proceeds go towards helping people affected by cancer. Preheat the oven at 180c/375f or 160c/320f (fan oven). I have been roped into baking for a fundraiser but my cooker is a very old aga which is fine for one cake but the temperature is hugely unreliable (can be so hot cakes end up burnt but raw) and drops considerably if the door is being opened and closed (eg to put in cake after cake).</p>
