<p><strong>Cake Flour Pastry Flour</strong>. Avoid using pastry flour for anything that demands structure, like bread doughs or pastas. What this means for your baked goods is that they’ll be less heavy (because there’s less gluten weighing everything down) and more tender. Cake flour is another flour with a low protein content, which is sometimes confused with pastry flour. It is usually present or available in the unbleached form and can be a good option that.</p>

When it comes to cake flour, the wheat is milled until it has a fine consistency. The difference between cake flour and pastry flour is that cake flour has a lower protein content, and pastry flour has a relatively high protein content. Using cake and pastry flour will give you a more delicate, crumbly, and airier cake and pastry!
