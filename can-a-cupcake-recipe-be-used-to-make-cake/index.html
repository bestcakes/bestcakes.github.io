<p><strong>Can A Cupcake Recipe Be Used To Make Cake</strong>. Perfect vanilla cupcakes from scratch. In canada we get a 300ml can of condensed milk unlike in the us where you can get a 14oz can (which is approximately 400ml). I doubled the recipe and used 2 tbsp. I decided to make this for my boyfriend’s birthday, and we both loved it :).</p>

<p>Cupcakes are best eaten on the day they are made but if you really have to store them, put them in an airtight container and refrigerate for about 2 days. Bake for 18 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs. Sometimes all you really want is a little chocolate. I will definitely make this again! In canada we get a 300ml can of condensed milk unlike in the us where you can get a 14oz can (which is approximately 400ml). I created this recipe to make it easier on everyone when you reach for a cupcake recipe — you can even make a batch of all different flavors for a picky crowd.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-substitute-the-buttermilk">Can i substitute the buttermilk?</h3><p>I created this recipe to make it easier on everyone when you reach for a cupcake recipe — you can even make a batch of all different flavors for a picky crowd. The cake layers may bake up slightly thinner, and the bake times may need to be adjusted. It was perfect for a cookies n cream cake. You can also make your own buttermilk at a ratio of 1 cup whole milk to 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice. I used the baking instructions from the chocolate cake recipe (350f oven, 35 minutes, center rack). While this recipe is used by bakeries all over the world, it is easy enough to make that a beginner can whip up a batch.</p>

<p>Now i know it might seem strange that i’m telling you not to follow the instructions. It yields light, fluffy, moist cupcakes that dome perfectly, and you can really taste the vanilla in every bite. Sometimes all you really want is a little chocolate. Super moist, though a little on the denser side. It took about an hour and 10 minutes to bake.</p>

<p>I’ve also used bob’s red mill egg replacer as well as a flax egg with great success. Intense chocolate cake, fluffy cream filling, fudgy ganache and an iconic vanilla swirl. I created this recipe to make it easier on everyone when you reach for a cupcake recipe — you can even make a batch of all different flavors for a picky crowd. I’ve shared several different chocolate cake and cupcake recipes, including the ones used in these nutella chocolate cupcakes and this easy moist chocolate cake.and while i love them all, if i could only ever bake one chocolate cupcake ever. You can definitely add sprinkles to this, 1/3 of a cup should do, to make this an amazing funfetti cupcake!</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier try cake flour for the all purpose flour used in the recipe to get a fluffier cake. For his birthday i wanted to bake a eggless chocolate cake with frosting and all. You can make cake pops with your favorite homemade cake recipe; Cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the large egg in the recipe. I will definitely make this again!</p>

<p>It had a soy milk ganache for the frosting and it also. I used the baking instructions from the chocolate cake recipe (350f oven, 35 minutes, center rack). Sometimes all you really want is a little chocolate. Line the muffin pan with cupcake liners, it helps the cake come out easily from the pan, reduces your clean up and on a lighter note, it makes the cake prettier! Plain kefir will also work well instead of buttermilk.</p>
