<p><strong>Can I Make Cake Ahead</strong>. If you’re baking your cakes more than two days ahead of time, i recommend freezing your cake layers. However, you should wait to coat the panko until right before frying so that the crab cakes do not get soggy. In the event that you answered yes to those questions, then you can clearly prepare your dessert ahead of time. Some cakes, like cheesecakes, require some advanced work so they have enough time to chill overnight.</p>
