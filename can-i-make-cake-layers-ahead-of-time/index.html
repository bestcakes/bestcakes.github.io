<p><strong>Can I Make Cake Layers Ahead Of Time</strong>. Make sure the layers are completely cool to the touch before freezing. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and store in the fridge or at room temperature depending on the stability of the filling. If you assemble too early, the cake will become soggy as the strawberry juices permeate the cake. Fondant or gum paste decorations can be made weeks in advance and stored in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>

<p>Again, it’s important that you let the cakes cool completely before wrapping them up. Cakes can be filled and crumb coated up to a day in advance. The elements of this cake can be made ahead of time. In fact, it might just be my imagination, but i think cakes that have been frozen come out even more moist! I agree that freezing the cake layers ahead of time is the best option here. When you make a cake with chilled cake layers (thawed out of the freezer for 30 minutes), you reduce the amount of crumbing.</p>

The cake should be leveled and built after the layers have been thawed for about 30 minutes. Before storing your cake, wrap it completely in one to two layers of plastic wrap to keep it moist. Make cake and fill, wrap in parchment and foil. This will allow any birthdays or celebrations to run more smoothly, as you won’t be rushing in the kitchen to get everything done in time. Can cake layers be made ahead?</p>

<p>You can slice the strawberries in half and store on paper towel lined plate with paper towels in between the layers of strawberries 24 hours ahead of time.

<p>Kendra's notes (step 6) are very specific about letting the meringues completely cool off. I find that its easier to ice them frozen. Make cake and fill, wrap in parchment and foil. Can cake layers be made ahead? That just makes the cakes a little taller, but with 6 inch round cake layers, it may be just fine to go with two layers.</p>

<p>Tightly wrap each layer in plastic wrap, making sure that no part of the cake is exposed to air. You can slice the strawberries in half and store on paper towel lined plate with paper towels in between the layers of strawberries 24 hours ahead of time. Thaw in the fridge a day before icing so the cakes can defrost slowly. The cake should be leveled and built after the layers have been thawed for about 30 minutes. Again, it’s important that you let the cakes cool completely before wrapping them up.</p>

<p>I like to do this if i have a cake deadline in the near future but don’t have the availability to make the cake near the time i actually need to deliver it or serve it. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and store in the fridge or at room temperature depending on the stability of the filling. Save time and stress in the kitchen. Bake your cake layers, then let them cool completely at room temperature. Kendra's notes (step 6) are very specific about letting the meringues completely cool off.</p>

<p>As far as how many layers for each cake, i like to go with three layers. Many experienced bakers will shut the oven off, then leave the meringues inside overnight to let them firm up. Here are my recommendations for freezing cakes: If properly wrapped (doubled wrapped! Can i make a cake 3 days in advance?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://bestcakes.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://sevenlayercharlotte.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_9066-986x1024.jpg" alt="Chocolate Chip Cookie Chocolate Birthday Cake" title="Chocolate Chip Cookie Chocolate Birthday Cake" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/bestcakes.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />

<p>Another option is to make the entire cake ahead of time and freeze it. For extra sturdiness during storage, you can place a cardboard cake round in between each layer before stacking them. Cake layers can be made a few weeks in advance as long as they cool completely before wrapping in plastic wrap and foil and frozen. I wrote an entire blog post about how to freeze, thaw and transport you cakes. If properly wrapped (doubled wrapped!</p>

<p>Two days before you want to start decorating, thaw it in the fridge first then on the counter. If you don't intend to frost the cake until the day of the event, you can bake it up to a week in advance. Over the past few years, i’ve tested multiple different ways. ), cake layers can be made several weeks in advance. Bake your cake layers, then let them cool completely at room temperature.</p>
