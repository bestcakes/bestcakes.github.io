<p><strong>Can Vegan Cheese Cakes Be Refrigerated</strong>. The shelf life of cheesecake is influenced by a variety of factors, such as the type of cake, the preservatives used, the packaging date and how it is stored. Although cream cheese icing must be refrigerated for safety, it can be made well ahead of the event and stored in the refrigerator. This method, for a fully assembled cake, has to be expedited and requires a special refrigerated box. At this point, you may consume, refrigerate, or refreeze.</p>

Fill any baking pan about halfway up with water, and place the pan of water on your oven’s lower rack. **** dairy free cream tends not to whip as firmly as dairy cream, which is why i recommend that the cheesecake is frozen rather than being refrigerated, otherwise it can be a bit too soft.
