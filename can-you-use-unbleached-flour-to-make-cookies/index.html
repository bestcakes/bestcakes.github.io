<p>White bleached flour is best used for pie crusts, some cakes, cookies, pancakes and waffles. So why exactly does bread flour make chewier cookies?

<p>Is unbleached flour good for baking? It all comes down to the key distinguishing factor between different types of flour: The common wisdom is that you can use bleached and unbleached flours interchangeably. Higher protein flours, such as bread or unbleached flour, can create more chewy cookies due to the strong elastic gluten. Bleached flour tends to have a bit lower protein content than unbleached, but these cookies are beautifully tender regardless, and you should do fine.</p>

<p>Bleached or unbleached refers to a chemical process the flour may have been through to make it whiter. Since it has a finer texture and absorbs more liquid, it is a good choice for cookies. Unbleached flour is typically used for yeast bread and pastries such as puff pastries, éclairs, strudel and cream puffs and yes, home baked pizza!dec 29, 2016. Bleached flour tends to have a bit lower protein content than unbleached, but these cookies are beautifully tender regardless, and you should do fine. Unbleached flour is a better choice than bleached flour from an environmental standpoint because it hasn't been chemically treated.</p>
