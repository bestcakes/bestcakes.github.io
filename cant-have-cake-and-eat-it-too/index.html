<p><strong>Cant Have Cake And Eat It Too</strong>. There are so many areas of our life where we try to live life without any consequence. You can’t have your cake and eat it too as a child i did not understand the saying, “you can’t have your cake and eat it too.” it seemed to me that if someone remembered your birthday and baked you a cake and you admired it for an hour while everyone played games, and then you and everyone else ate it, well… you had your cake and ate it too. It’s all a comfortable, comforting choice ($1 dollar of the $100 you’re spending goes to climate programs and nevermind where the $99 is going). Linguists have long argued if the saying really makes any sense at all, with some concluding that you can actually have your cake and eat it simultaneously;</p>
