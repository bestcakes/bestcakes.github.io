<p><strong>Caramel Cupcake Frosting Recipe</strong>. Now your cupcakes are ready to bake! Started frosting the cake about 5 minutes after finishing mixing because even though it s still warm it stiffens quickly. Years ago, my friend hannah made the vegan gingerbread cupcakes recipe from vegan cupcakes take over the world with her own special twist. Submitter calls this a good creamy caramel frosting. that's an understatement.</p>

<p>Now your cupcakes are ready to bake! If you are making cupcakes, you should be able to frost 24 cupcakes if you apply the frosting with a knife. I knew it would be before i even added the powdered sugar and thought to myself that i'd like to pour some of that caramel sauce over ice cream or a piece of apple pie or apple cake. Best caramel icing i ever ate and not grainy at all. Use a standard muffin pan and place a muffin liner in each muffin cup. You can swirl the frosting on top of the cupcake with a spoon or spatula, place the frosting into a zip top bag and snip the corner to use as a quick frosting bag, or use a frosting bag fitted.</p>
