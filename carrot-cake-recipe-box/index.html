<p>Canola oil will work great too. It's important to cool the cakes completely before frosting, otherwise the frosting will just melt right off. This 6 inch small carrot cake recipe with pineapple, coconut, walnuts, and raisins is a super moist carrot cake for two from scratch decorated with homemade cream cheese frosting. You'll love the texture this pretty, moist treat gets from pineapple, coconut and, of course, carrots! I also used a food processor to grate the carrot which saved a lot of time.</p>
