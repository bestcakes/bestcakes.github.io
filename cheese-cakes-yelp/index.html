<p>The texture of the cheesecake is light and fluffy, yet firm enough that it doesn't fall apart when you cut into it. They have some truly delicious and innovative lemonades, as well as italian sodas, fancy italian donuts (zepoles) if you get there early enough, and a wide assortment of mini cheesecakes, saw some cannolis, funfetti frozen ice cream cheesecake, 6. I'm waiting for them to put up pinball machines here. To be honest, i saw the yelp reviews and was a little nervous. I've had the sweet potato, caramel apple streusel, strawberry shortcake, twisted lemon, turtle, golden oreo, key lime and chocolate ganache. This creamy oreo cheesecake is chock full of those delicious cookies, crowned with beautiful swirled icing and whole oreos.</p>
<h3 id="but-be-advised-that-nothing-moves">But be advised that nothing moves.</h3><p>This option seemed to have more cake than cheesecake, featuring layers of vanilla cake as well as mousse in vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate flavors. Home of the world's most fabulous cheesecake. Please note our 45th st times square location is now open. 1 review of antoinettes cheesecakes so today april 6 2021 i went into this place because the cheesecake looks amazing! If you want some truly amazing and tasty cheesecake this place is a must! Remember the famous cheesecake at la cave?</p>

<p>The cheesecake factory restaurant at 875 north michigan avenue in the john hancock center offers a great selection of cheesecake, specialty entrees, appetizers, cocktails, wine, beer, and happy hour, with more than 250 items made fresh from scratch every day This option seemed to have more cake than cheesecake, featuring layers of vanilla cake as well as mousse in vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate flavors. I was very disappointed, because this is one of my signature dishes i order and it was the first time i had to discard it. Plus, the entire slice was coated in a rich buttercream frosting.
