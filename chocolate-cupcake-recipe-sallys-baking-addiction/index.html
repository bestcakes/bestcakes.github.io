<p><strong>Chocolate Cupcake Recipe Sallys Baking Addiction</strong>. The cupcake looks pretty but agree with the review that the it has a dense texture, it also didn’t have much taste overall and with the frosting, tasted slightly like toothpaste for me. Built the same way as lion dvd. This is a solid base recipe that serves as a jumping off point for many others. I burned the iso image to a dual layer dvd, and it was recognized upon boot.</p>
