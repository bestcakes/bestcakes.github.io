<p>I live in india and it's hot in here for crying out loud. I used ermine frosting and i just let it stay in the. I also add meringue powder to the icing, helps icing to crust. When it comes to tessa’s best buttercream recipe, the ingredients are simple. For best results, put the bowl (stainless steel is the best) you will be using to make the frosting in freezer for at least an hour prior to making the the best whipped cream frosting.</p>

<p>Still, cupcake frosting needs to be firm, to retain its shape. Also, it is so super easy to make. It stays as it is for days. I use all high ratio shortening &amp; the cornstarch. On a side note, i was experimenting with this recipe and even though you said it doesn't mix well with fruit, cream cheese etc.</p>
