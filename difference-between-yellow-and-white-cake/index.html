<p><strong>Difference Between Yellow And White Cake</strong>. The yellow color of the egg yolks in white cake mix makes it require egg whites instead of whole eggs. The extra fat added from the egg yolks also contributes to the cake’s texture, making it moister and a bit denser than a white cake. 2) base cakes made from yellow cake mix are richer, moister, and more bodied as compared to those made out of the white kind.

<p>The distinction between these two broad categories of cake is in the fat content. Adding the egg yolks and increasing the amount of vegetable oil is all it takes to change a white cake to yellow. The yellow color of the egg yolks in white cake mix makes it require egg whites instead of whole eggs. A recent post on chowhound spells out the difference between yellow and white cake.
