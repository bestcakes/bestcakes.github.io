<p>180 calories, 9 g fat (3 g saturated fat), 90 mg sodium, 25 g carbs (0 g fiber, 17 g sugar), cookie&lt;/strong&gt; is made up of a dangerous trifecta: These cookies are great for those who have a sugar restricted diet. You can roll the cookies in additional granular sugar alternative if desired prior to placing onto the cookie sheet. It need only happen to you once and you will steer clear of them. Carbohydrates are found in large amounts in starchy and sweet foods, including bread, cereal, pasta, rice, potatoes, fruit, fruit juices, cookies, cake, desserts, and sugary drinks, and they are what cause blood sugar to rise.</p>

<p>I got this recipe originally from sugarless cookies (for diabetics) recipe recipes.eu.com recipe collection. Add applesauce, egg, oil and vanilla. The syrups, well, those are tough.
