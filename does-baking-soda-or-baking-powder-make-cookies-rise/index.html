<p><strong>Does Baking Soda Or Baking Powder Make Cookies Rise</strong>. Baking soda is also known by its chemist term: It is possible to make cookies without baking soda or baking powder, but the resulting cookie will be dense. This is because carbon dioxide is not being produced by a chemical reaction that typically occurs when baking soda or powder is present in the cookie batter. Baking soda and baking powder are not interchangeable so never use one of these ingredients when the recipe calls for the other.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide gas is produced when one of the acid salts reacts with baking soda. When moistened in a dough or batter, a chemical reaction takes place that produces carbon dioxide gas, inflating cookies, cakes, and pancakes. As a result, carbon dioxide gas is released more quickly when it is released from this acid. This is because carbon dioxide is not being produced by a chemical reaction that typically occurs when baking soda or powder is present in the cookie batter. Baking soda is also known by its chemist term: Baking powder contains baking soda, but the two substances are used under different conditions.</p>

Baking soda is used in cookies because it gives the cookies a chewy, coarse texture when mixed with an acid. As a chemical name, baking soda is also known as sodium bicarbonate. Baking soda is also known by its chemist term: Baking powder is basically just baking soda with acid added in. The second reaction takes place when the batter is placed in the oven.</p>
