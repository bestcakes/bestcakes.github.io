<p><strong>History Of Opera Cake</strong>. Years later, the renowned parisian patisserie dalloyau reintroduced and popularized it as l'opera. Opera cake is a famous french dessert with several hundred years of history. The owners of pâtisserie dalloyau, on the other hand, claim that they were the one who invented the opera cake back in 1955. Some sources claim there was a type of opera cake sold in paris as long ago as 1890, and some think the parisian specialty was created closer to 1950.</p>

<p>There are many stories about the origins of this cake, known as both clichy cake and opéra cake. Each cake is topped with a thin layer of chocolate ganache and is usually decorated with a symbol of a note, musical instruments, or merely the word opera written in chocolate. Believed to be created in the late 19th century by famed pastry chef louis clichy, the dessert later became known as l'opera , possibly because its many layers reminded patrons of separate operatic “acts.” Dalloyau have been trading since 1682 and were suppliers to the court of versailles.
