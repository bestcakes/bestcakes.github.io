<p><strong>How Does Baking Soda Make Cookies Rise</strong>. Specifically, the baking soda (a base) reacts with the acid to give you carbon dioxide gas, water, and salt. Instead of adding more liquid to your dough (like sour cream or buttermilk), you can simply add a bit of baking powder. One trick to keep in mind is that both baking powder and baking soda gives rise, but baking soda also spreads due to its leavening strength in small amounts. When baking soda is mixed with an acid, the baking soda produces bubbles and carbon dioxide gas, which causes the raw dough or batter to rise.</p>
