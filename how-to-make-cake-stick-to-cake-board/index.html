<p><strong>How To Make Cake Stick To Cake Board</strong>. Never have, but that's not a bad idea. Apply some on the base and put the base tier in the centre of the board. Turn it over and stick it down to the cake board. After your boards are glued together, cover the top of the board in a thin layer of shortening.</p>

<p>Dowels go in straight better if the cake is chilled. I recommend using a 12mm cake board for your celebration cakes. For larger cakes, in order not to use too much fondant on the cake board (basically avoid wastage as most part of the cake board will be covered by cake), i place my cake on the cake board first and then roll a long strip of fondant around to cover the cake board. This will help it stick. Make sure the base tier is in the centre of the cake board, adjust immediately if required. Stick the pointy end of the skewer down through the center of the top cake.</p>

Then, use the cake board for the next tier to mark the circle where the cake will go (i put this. The last time i transported a cake, by the time it made it home, the sides where the frosting was were stuck all over the sides of the bos and the top where the flowers were was smashed and the writing had smeared off. Preheat the oven in 180 degrees. Make sure the base tier is in the centre of the cake board, adjust immediately if required. The buttercream acts like glue and the coconut easily sticks to the cream.</p>

<p>Cut the styrofoam in whichever shape and form you desire. Once you go to invert the cake, make the distance from the pan to. All tiers must still be on their cardboard supports. Add vanilla essence and a pinch of salt. The buttercream acts like glue and the coconut easily sticks to the cream.</p>

<p>Now, place this cake on your turntable. Add vanilla essence and a pinch of salt. For smaller ones, i tend to cover the whole cake board with fondant and then place my cake on it. After your boards are glued together, cover the top of the board in a thin layer of shortening. This is especially useful when working with a bundt cake pan that has lots of nooks and crannies where the cake can potentially get stuck.</p>

<p>This will give you a flat surface to decorate. Use the same size cake board to make the center of the cake. Never have, but that's not a bad idea. Tap or press the dowels in, to make sure they hit the cake board on the bottom, then cut the dowel with scissors to ensure it is not sticking out or showing; Use a piece of string to measure the top and sides of the cake.</p>

Williams recommends running a butter knife around the perimeter of the cake, gently pressing into the cake to lift it off the edges and center before inverting it. Level the top of the cake using a serrated knife, if needed.</p>

<p>You should roll out the fondant so that its about 1/2″ wider than the cake boards size. Using the side of your pliers, gently pound the skewer down through the cakes til you feel it hit the bottom board. Add vanilla essence and a pinch of salt. Use royal icing as glue to stick the tiers to the board and with each other. This will help it stick.</p>

<p>Cover your cake in shredded coconut. Then, use the cake board for the next tier to mark the circle where the cake will go (i put this. Once all the dowels are put in place, place the next tier on top. I sat the cake on the floor in the back of the car and nothing was on top of it or around it and it still got messed up. I personally add a cake board for each tier my cake will have to ensure it will be strong enough to hold my cake, so one and two tier cakes get two boards, three tiers get three, four get four and so on.</p>

<p>This will help it stick. You should roll out the fondant so that its about 1/2″ wider than the cake boards size. The cool part is that the skewer will go right through the cardboard of the uppermost cake. For this construction cake i used water to attach the “2” and the road markings on the cake and the fondant to the cake board, vodka to layer the flat details on the truck and loader, edible glue on the wheels and the heavier details, and melted fondant to stick the piles of “gravel” to the cake board. The last time i transported a cake, by the time it made it home, the sides where the frosting was were stuck all over the sides of the bos and the top where the flowers were was smashed and the writing had smeared off.</p>
