<p>Make sure to check out craft chameleon if you searching for nice, quality acrylic! Post #1 of 14 hi everyone, i have made a cake which is just basic, but i want to put wires coming out of the centre with stars on the end? You should see the faint line of the wire inside the star but it should not be poking out from either side. When we think about how to decorate a cake in a quick and effective way, an exploding cake with multiple objects on sticks is often a good way to go. Does anyone know the best way to make these?</p>

<p>With your gold paper in hand (we spray painted plain white cardstock to achieve the color we wanted), punch out your star shapes with the fiskars® star lever punch.

<p>Add a little icing or edible glue around the wooden dowel. Resize images to fit your cake. My trick for easily applying acetate to adhesive foam is to place the foam adhesive side up on a cricut mat. If you would like to make your own edible stars, check. These really make for a beautiful addition to any cake and add a touch of class to any occasion.</p>
