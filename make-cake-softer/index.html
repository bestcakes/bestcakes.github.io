<p><strong>Make Cake Softer</strong>. This is what makes a cake moist and soft secretly. Butter is higher in fat, so it will moisten your cake. Emulsifiers hold water and fat together, so adding extra egg yolks to the batter allows the batter to hold more liquid and, consequently, more sugar. Furthermore, you can replace some of the butter in your recipe with oil to reduce gluten production and achieve better results.</p>
