<p>If you do not have access to a mixer, you can take steps to ensure your cake ends up as light as possible. With a hand mixer, you might not have to do any stirring or whisking, like you would with a manual mixer, but you still have to work the mixer around the mixing bowl by hand to ensure that all of your ingredients are thoroughly mixed. But you can't simply throw all the ingredients into the blender and let it rip. A hand mixer proves an easy substitute for mixing up cake batter with excellent results. I did make it with a handheld mixer for years so i know it can be done. The batter can be made in one bowl and only requires a wooden spoon or spatula to gently incorporate the ingredients together, resulting in one moist cake.</p>

Using a blender to mix cake batter can save the day if you don't have a hand mixer available. I did make it with a handheld mixer for years so i know it can be done. Whenever possible, you should mix cake batter with an electric mixer, because mixing cakes by hand can make them more dense.

<p>A stand mixer or a hand mixer can definitely come in handy when you're making cakes, cookies, or other desserts, but if you don't own one, or it isn't handy, don't worry. Most cake and cookie dough batters as well as frosting or cream can be done with either a hand mixer or stand mixer like the recipes below.carrot cake chocolate ho ho cake four layer cake with creme chantilly &amp; berries but there are some recipes, such as for bread dough, that a hand mixer cannot be used in place of stand mixer. That means deliciously incorporated batters and fluffy cakes. I add the ingredients and turn it on. In comparison to stand mixers, hand mixers are compact to store and inexpensive.they are less powerful than stand mixers, so are perfect.</p>
