<p>How can you decide whether to use only baking powder or only soda or both Too much flour in a cake will also cause it to be dense. We use buttermilk for the same reasons in my regular no yeast bread, too. When baking a cake, the acid comes in the form of vinegar, lemon, buttermilk, yogurt, cream of tartar, or even coffee. Both the baking soda and baking powder start the rise immediately when an acid and liquid are added. If double acting, the baking powder will continue to rise from the heat of the oven.</p>
<h3 id="feel-free-to-skip-the-egg">Feel free to skip the egg.</h3><p>Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate (a pure base). When baking soda mixes with something acidic (vinegar, cream of tartar or lemon juice, for example), it will begin to bubble and produce a carbon dioxide gas. Using too much baking soda or baking powder can really mess up a recipe, causing it to rise uncontrollably and taste terrible. Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is an alkaline compound that is commonly used in baking as a leavener. Feel free to skip it to make a slightly lighter loaf. The process of making souffle pancakes requires very few steps.</p>
