<p>Your missionary will be able to purchase most personal products, but he or she might not have access to a favorite brand or scent. This is a white cake with lemon and raspberry filling, covered in buttercream and then fondant. Instead of opening his call, he let his family open it and then he asked questions to guess where he was going. But they wouldn't lay right, or stay tied, and finally, i got the genius idea of just pinching the tie where i wanted the knot to be and pleating it a little with my fingers and gluing it. This cake is all about layers, and working from the bottom to the top.</p>
