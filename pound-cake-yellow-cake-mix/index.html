<p><strong>Pound Cake Yellow Cake Mix</strong>. It's a cake that starts from a mix but becomes so much more by the addition of a few key ingredients. Cream cheese, large eggs, cake mix, sugar, water, vegetable oil and 1 more. There are two reasons that i finally ended up in this yellow cake recipe: No need to bake 100% from scratch (and no one will know you cheated and used a mix!).</p>
