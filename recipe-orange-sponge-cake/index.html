<p><strong>Recipe Orange Sponge Cake</strong>. This italian sponge cake, also known as pan di spagna has only 5 ingredients. In a sponge cake, there is more egg than flour which allows it to have a very foamy, springy texture (think of angel cake here). A pound cake has heavy fat content that comes from the butter, making it a pound cake, not a sponge cake. Sponge cake is a light cake made with egg whites, flour and sugar, sometimes leavened with baking powder.</p>
