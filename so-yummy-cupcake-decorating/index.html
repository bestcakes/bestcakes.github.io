<p>Pumpkin isn't a flavor that works only in pies. I can’t thank you enough for all the suggestions 🙂. If you're using pie filling in the center gently press the bottom down on the inside of the cupcake after hollowing it out but before filling it so that it's compressed. We make recipes that are easy to create but still have a “wow” factor that guests and kids can’t get over. But it's not like anyone in my family is going to pick up my crafts and admire them.</p>
