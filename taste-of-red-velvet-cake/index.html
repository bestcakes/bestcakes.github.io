<p><strong>Taste Of Red Velvet Cake</strong>. I baked it in two 8 inch pans and sliced them in half to create 4 layers. It also has cocoa powder added to it for a mild chocolate flavoring. No one was asking what is red velvet, but more so just comparing the softer texture to that of velvet due to the dye and butter recipe used at the time. She would go to the trouble of making the cake, cooking the frosting, and carefully frosting it.</p>
