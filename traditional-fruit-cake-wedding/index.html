<p>A traditional english cake is a very dense fruitcake covered in a thick layer of marzipan (up to one inch thick) and then either covered in royal icing, or the more modern twist. The tradition for a fruit cake wedding cake began in the 16th century in britain, when sugarcane became readily available from the west indies.

Add the brandy, mix well and cover with cling film. We have other types, but chocolate mud is by far the favourite. Put the fruit, marmalade and rum/brandy in a large mixing bowl.</p>
