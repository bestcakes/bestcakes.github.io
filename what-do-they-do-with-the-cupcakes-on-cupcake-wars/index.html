<p>Each team must feature improved versions of the four cupcakes they made in the first two rounds and must showcase them on an elaborately constructed display. They do make one thousand. I hadn’t really thought seriously about cupcake wars until they invited me to compete. If they didn't let them cool, the icing would be sliding down the side of the cupcakes. Granted this is a new series and they are still working out all the kinks… but come on food network!!!</p>

<p>Plus my fiancé says that there is no way those carpenters could create those displays in. ” that means not one cupcake prepared in the competition is a styrofoam dummy — the judges have to be able to pick any one at random and it has to taste just as good as the next one (or next 900). They're actually able to bring ingredients premixed. For some reason, this works for them! Yes people it is tv, they don’t shoot the show and the event on the same day.</p>

<p>I hadn’t really thought seriously about cupcake wars until they invited me to compete. They have their cute little cupcake shops and their cute little assistants and this evil glint in their twitchy little eyes when people don’t do what they want. Coconut cupcakes with chocolate ganache filling, topped with caramel buttercream frosting and toasted coconut I had to ask because i never believed it, especially for the final when they have to make 1000 cupcakes she said that even during challenges sometimes they would be asked to do things again if the camera missed it and that made things even more stressful because of the time.

<p>New york cheesecake cupcakes w/ ginger cookie crust, vanilla cake, filled with raspberry compote, topped with cream cheese frosting and raspberry coulis. I mean really 1000 cupcakes in 2 hours with only kitchen aid mixers and 2 ovens not including all the little fondant decorations that they put on top. To me, it seemed as though cupcake wars was just like any other food competition show with cupcakes tossed in as the main attraction.
