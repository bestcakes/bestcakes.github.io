<p>This cake gets its name because of how its ingredients can be measured: Hi , i baked cakes for 37 years. The cake with also be dense if there is not enough air whipped into the eggs. A cake that bakes too slowly takes longer to set and may fall, causing a dense texture. Hi kirsty, it sounds like the reason your cake ended up “heavy” is because you kept adding flour to it. Dense cakes are often rich and decadent.</p>
<h3 id="a-pound-cake-is-usually-baked-in-loaf-form-or-in-a-bundt-pan">A pound cake is usually baked in loaf form or in a bundt pan.</h3><p>A pound cake is usually baked in loaf form or in a bundt pan. The cake is typically fairly dense, and is often made either in sheet cake form or in a bundt pan, though other options work as well. Dense vs fluffy cake a cake that is overly dense typically has too much liquid, too much sugar or too little leavening (not excess flour, as is commonly thought). It can easily happen without you even realizing you made an error. The cake typically has a very moist, crumbly texture that tends not to hold its shape very well. A dense cake is one of the most common mistakes that bakers of all experience levels make.</p>

<p>A pound of butter, a pound of sugar, a pound of eggs, and a pound of flour. Hi , i baked cakes for 37 years. And once any flour is added, the mixing has to be slower still. To thicken or dense up a cake mix, you need to make adjustments. If some of your ingredients are cold, they make it more difficult to mix together your batter and can impact the rise of your cake.</p>

<p>To make a spongecake light, it is very important to whip the eggs a lot to incorporate air. Your recipe has very little flour, and lots of eggs, so it may be intended to be a denser cake to begin with.you might want to look for some basic white or yellow cake recipes. A cake that is overly dense typically has too much liquid, too much sugar or too little leavening (not excess flour, as is commonly thought). Cake mixes that bake up light and fluffy often include less fat and sugar and greater amounts of baking powder. Baking is as much a matter of technique as it is about the actual ingredients.</p>

<p>Hi kirsty, it sounds like the reason your cake ended up “heavy” is because you kept adding flour to it. Less fat and sugar mean a reduction in the weight, or denseness of the cake, while the leavening properties of baking powder increase the volume of a cake mix as it bakes.
