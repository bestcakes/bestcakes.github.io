<p><strong>What Is The Best Cake Mix In A Box</strong>. My favorite recipe is 1 box cake mix, 2 tbs soft butter, 3 tbs water, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup chocolate chips (though i never measure chips and pour until it looks good 😂). By using half of the box of the cake mix of your choice you'll obtain the perfect small cake, and save the rest of the mix for another time. 12×17″ size would also work too! Your dry ingredients are all set and prepared in the box of cake mix, so all you have to worry about is the wet ingredients.</p>
