<p><strong>Why Does Bread Make Cookies Soft</strong>. Soft cookies should be kept in air tight containers. You’ll notice this after a day or so (if your cookies last that long) when you open the cookie jar and find, essentially, a crouton. Use dark brown sugar (more molasses) instead of light brown sugar. Be sure to separate soft cookies from crispy cookies, as one can affect the texture of the other (they actually have an opposite effect — crispy cookies dry out softer ones, while soft cookies leach their moisture to crisp ones).</p>

<p>It won't be nearly as sticky, and anyone who's tried to roll out cookie dough before knows that there's only so much that flour can do. If you don't have an air tight container, adding a slice of bread will help keep them soft. The bread will turn hard while your cookies stay soft and chewy.
