<p><strong>You Can T Eat Your Cake And Have It</strong>. Used for expressing the impossibility of having something both ways, if those two ways conflict. The proverb you can’t have your cake and eat it (too) means you can’t enjoy both of two desirable but mutually exclusive alternatives. To “have your cake and eat it too”, suggests having a cake and not eating it at all, while to “eat your cake and have it too” more clearly highlights the conflicting ideals here. In contemporary english we say, ‘you can’t have your cake and eat it too’.</p>
