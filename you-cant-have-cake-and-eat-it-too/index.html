You can’t have your cake and eat it (too) is a popular english idiomatic proverb or figure of speech. There are so many areas of our life where we try to live life without any consequence. “you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.” is inherently unclear because it is out of order chronologically.</p>

<p>Used for expressing the impossibility of having something both ways, if those two ways conflict. Obviously once you've eaten your cake, you won't have it any more. If you don't eat it, the cake will get stale and moldy and inedible. If you get a piece of cake, you could either save it for later or eat it right away. If you eat the cake now, the end consequence is that you won’t have it later. Small wonder, then, that the phrase has direct equivalents in many languages.</p>
<h3 id="less-well-known-is-its-curious-history">Less well known is its curious history.</h3><p>Less well known is its curious history. We have to go back further to finds the proverb’s true origins. You can't have your cake and eat it (, too) proverb you cannot have or do two things that are both desirable but normally contradictory or impossible to have or do simultaneously. Because have can also mean eat, this expression may seem redundant. This phrase is easier to understand if it is read as you can't eat your cake, and have it too. Small wonder, then, that the phrase has direct equivalents in many languages.</p>

<p>To do or have two desired things at the same time; “you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.” is inherently unclear because it is out of order chronologically. There is absolutely no difference in meaning between the two orderings: “you can’t eat your cake and have it too. The two options are mutually exclusive.</p>
